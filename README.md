# Film_Watchlist

https://film-watchlist.netlify.app/ 

An application to create a watchlist of films, using: HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript and The Movie Database API.
Users are able to search for films or can view films currently in cinemas. 
Information about each film is viewable including: 
Title, Release Year, Age Rating, Film Overview, Genres, Review and Streaming services the film is available on. 

This project was created to practise consuming API's and to get to grips with promises.
